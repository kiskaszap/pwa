**UWS Adventure App ‚Äì React PWA**

A mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for University of the West of Scotland students. Built using React.js, Leaflet.js, and Tailwind CSS, this app offers an interactive experience where students complete geolocation-based tasks around the Paisley campus.

**Overview**

The app allows students to:

- Register with their UWS email
- Take a selfie that becomes their avatar on the map
- View an interactive campus map
- Complete campus-based tasks (quiz/photo/text input)
- Track completed or failed tasks

The app works offline using IndexedDB (via Dexie.js), and can be installed as a PWA on mobile and desktop.

Live Demo: <https://incandescent-mousse-06ec77.netlify.app/>

**Features**

- React PWA with offline capabilities
- Geolocation task triggering
- Leaflet maps with custom icons
- Local task storage
- Toast notifications via React Hot Toast
- Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI for fast design

**Folder Structure**

**src/db ( Red Border)**

**db.js**

This file handles the offline storage logic using Dexie.js, which is a wrapper over IndexedDB.  
It is responsible for:

- Creating a new Dexie database instance.
- Defining the schema for storing completed and failed tasks.
- Exporting functions to add, retrieve, or clear data from IndexedDB.

Used to persist data when users are offline and synchronize when they return online.

**src/modal ( Light Blue Border)**

**TaskModals.jsx**

This file contains reusable modal components for tasks.  
It is used to:

- Display modal dialogs conditionally based on task types.
- Show task-specific details (quiz results, submission confirmations).
- Enhance the UX with custom overlays or popups.

**src/pages ( Green Border)**

This folder contains all major views/pages that the user interacts with:

**CompletedTask.jsx**

Displays a list of all successfully completed tasks, showing location, type, and timestamps.  
Includes filtering and minimal UX for progress tracking.

**Map.jsx**

Main interactive map interface:

- Uses React Leaflet to render the UWS campus map.
- Displays user‚Äôs real-time position.
- Shows geofenced task locations.
- Triggers navigation to /task/:id when within 10 meters of a task point.
- Shows custom markers based on task state (default, failed, completed).
- Provides a ‚ÄúNavigate‚Äù button with route line.
- Handles toast notifications for position, task availability, etc.

**Register.jsx**

Simple registration form:

- Accepts only UWS email addresses.
- Stores user info in localStorage.

**Selfie.jsx**

Allows the user to:

- Capture a selfie using device camera.
- Store it in localStorage as a base64 image.
- This image is later used as the user icon on the map.

**Splash.jsx**

- Initial loading screen (3.5s delay).
- Checks if user is logged in and has a selfie.
- Redirects to /login, /selfie, or /map accordingly.
- Registers the PWA install prompt using useRef.

**TasksPage.jsx**

- Handles individual task rendering depending on type (photo, text, quiz).
- Camera access for photo tasks.
- Textarea input for text tasks.
- Multiple choice for quiz tasks.
- Includes Toast messages for completion or failure.

**Trophy.jsx**

- Displays rewards earned (e.g., badges or trophies).
- May show stats like number of tasks completed, success rate.

**src/utils (üü° Yellow Border)**

Utility functions used throughout the project:

**geoUtils.js**

- Contains geolocation-related helper functions.
- Used to:
  - Calculate distances between coordinates.
  - Check if user is within a geofenced polygon.
  - Normalize coordinates and simplify complex turf.js logic.

**tasks.js**

- Static array of task definitions.
- Includes:
  - ID, type, name, description.
  - Geolocation coordinates.
  - Quiz options and correct answers (if applicable).
  - Fun facts and hints.

This file is essential for dynamic task rendering across the app.

**Global Files**

**App.js**

**User Guide**

**End-User Interaction Guide**

This comprehensive section explains how users interact with the UWS Adventure Progressive Web App (PWA). It covers everything from login and camera permissions to dynamic task activation, toast notifications, and task completion ensuring users have a smooth and guided experience.

**Splash Screen**

When the app launches, users are greeted by an animated splash screen displaying the UWS logo. Behind the scenes:

- A 3.5-second timer is initiated via setTimeout.
- After this period, the app checks:
  - If uws_user is not present in localStorage ‚Üí redirect to /login
  - If email exists, but no selfie found ‚Üí redirect to /selfie
  - If both are present ‚Üí redirect to /map

A hidden installation prompt (for PWA support) is captured via useRef and triggered on user interaction (logo click).

**!\[Splash\](<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiskaszap/pwa/main/mdImages/Picture12.png>)**

**Login (Email Registration)**
